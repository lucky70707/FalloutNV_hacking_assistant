# project goals
This is a console project I made to learn the Rust programming language. 
Its goal is to  narrow down the list of words from the fallout hacking minigame used in Fallout 3, new vegas, 4 and 76.
This is done by inputting words manually at this time. 
I want to make it into a gui application and use the words previously inputted by the user for autocompletion.
